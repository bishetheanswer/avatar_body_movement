# Avatar Body Movement
 3D character animation in Unity 2019.3.4f
 
 Created three main animations:
 - Jumping
 - Walking
 - Sitting

These animations have been created using the Timeline functionality on Unity.

Skeleton built using Animation Rigging package: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.animation.rigging@0.2/manual/index.html

Prefab used to apply these animations: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/basic-motions-free-pack-154271

*There are two extra animations created just for fun, you can disable these Game Objects if they bother you* :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
